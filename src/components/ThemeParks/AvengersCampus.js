The new land was originally set to open in the summer of 202, but was delayed due to the pandemic. While it's now set to open in 2021, Phase 2 of the land is expected to happen at some point down the line which will see a new Avengers-themed attraction that will be attached to the Avengers Headquarters building that will be part of the Phase 1 opening."

                    info="Benecio Del Toro, Bradley Cooper, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and Dave Bautista all reprise their roles for the attraction. The scenes for the attraction were largely filmed during production of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in Atlanta and directed by James Gunn, the film's director. The Fortress is filled with Marvel and Disney Park easter eggs, including a destroyed Ultron sentry, Inhuman Terrigen Crystals, and Figment from the Journey Into Imagination attraction at EPCOT."

The transformation from Tower of Terror into Guardians happened fairly quickly, with work on the exterior beginning in October 2016 while the former attraction still operated on the inside.

                    info="Tom Holland reprises his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man for the attraction. Above the show building, you'll be able to see Spider-Man swing off a web and flip through the air thanks to a groundbreaking stuntronic designed by Walt Disney Imagineering. Spider-Man sports a suit that's inspired by his MCU look, but unique to the Disney Parks and Resorts that was designed by Ryan Meinerding, the head of Visual Development for Marvel Studios. Meinerding designed Spidey's signature look for the MCU."

Concept art for the attraction showed the guest's seats in the Quinjet splitting off and moving around a battle independently, which may hint at the ride system in mind. It also depicted a battle happening in Wakanda, but it's unclear if that will still be a location destined for the attraction following Chadwick Boseman's untimely passing."

Here, you'll witness the master of the mystic arts practice his magic and meet him face to face."
                    info="The earliest concept poster for Avengers Campus depicted a ful-sized Sanctum building that resembled the New York Sanctum Sanctorum. It's unclear if that was just to illustrate the presence Doctor Strange would have in the land or if the plans were scaled down."
